# Spark Java Hello World Archetype for Maven
This Archetype helps people interested in trying spark for the first to get a working demo up in seconds.

## Build and Install the Archetype
If you wish to build the Archetype rather then download the jar from a repository you can simply run the maven command

        mvn install

This will compile the Archetype sources and install them into your local maven repository.

##Generate the Hello World Spark Project from the Archetype
Navigate to the directory where the new program will be created and run the following maven command:

    mvn archetype:generate \
        -DarchetypeGroupId=com.sparkjava \
        -DarchetypeArtifactId=sparkjava-helloworld-archetype \
        -DarchetypeVersion=1.0.0 \

        -DartifactId=your-articactid-here \
        -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT \
        -Dpackage=your.package.here
